# SensESP Chain Counter

This project implements a chain counter using [SensESP](https://signalk.org/SensESP/) on an ESP32 microcontroller. It's designed to measure and publish the deployed anchor chain length, making it ideal for marine applications such as anchoring systems.

## Features

- Real-time measurement of deployed chain length  
- Wi-Fi connectivity and configuration  
- Integration with Signal K via SensESP  
- Optional web-based configuration interface  

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32-based controller  
- Sensor to count chain revolutions (e.g. Hall effect sensor or encoder)
- Power supply for ESP32 and sensor  
- Wi-Fi network for Signal K integration  

## How It Works

- The system counts pulses generated by the windlass or a sensor detecting chain movement.
- Each pulse corresponds to a fixed chain length (e.g. 6 links Ã— 28 mm per pulse).
- Direction of movement (up, down, stopped) is also detected.
- The total chain deployed are calculated and published to Signal K as standard paths (e.g. anchor.chainLength, anchor.direction, etc.).
